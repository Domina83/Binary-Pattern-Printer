# Binary Pattern Printer (Fixed 01 Pattern)

This C program prints a triangle pattern using the repeating binary digits "01". The number of "01" pairs increases with each row.

## Language
C

## Description
- The program uses nested `for` loops.
- It prints 6 rows, each with increasing repetitions of the "01" string.

### Output Pattern
01
0101
010101
01010101
0101010101
010101010101

## How to Run
1. Save the code in a file named `binary_pattern.c`
2. Compile and run using:
```bash
gcc binary_pattern.c -o pattern
./pattern
